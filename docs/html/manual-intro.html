<a name="manual-intro.overview"></a>1.1. An Overview of Valgrind</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Valgrind is a suite of simulation-based debugging and profiling
tools for programs running on Linux (x86, amd64, ppc32 and ppc64).
The system consists of a core, which provides a synthetic CPU in
software, and a set of tools, each of which performs some kind of
debugging, profiling, or similar task.  The architecture is modular,
so that new tools can be created easily and without disturbing the
existing structure.</p>
<p>A number of useful tools are supplied as standard.  In
summary, these are:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Memcheck</strong></span> detects memory-management problems
    in programs.  All reads and writes of memory are checked, and
    calls to malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result,
    Memcheck can detect the following problems:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Use of uninitialised memory</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing memory after it has been
      free'd</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd
      blocks</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the
      stack</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd
      blocks are lost forever</p></li>
<li><p>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs
      free/delete/delete []</p></li>
<li><p>Overlapping <code class="computeroutput">src</code> and
      <code class="computeroutput">dst</code> pointers in
      <code class="computeroutput">memcpy()</code> and related
      functions</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Problems like these can be difficult to find by other means,
    often remaining undetected for long periods, then causing occasional,
    difficult-to-diagnose crashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Cachegrind</strong></span> is a cache profiler.  It
    performs detailed simulation of the I1, D1 and L2 caches in your CPU
    and so can accurately pinpoint the sources of cache misses in your
    code.  It will show the number of cache misses,
    memory references and instructions accruing to each line of source
    code, with per-function, per-module and whole-program summaries.  If
    you ask really nicely it will even show counts for each individual
    machine instruction.</p>
<p>On x86 and and64, Cachegrind auto-detects your machine's cache
    configuration using the <code class="computeroutput">CPUID</code>
    instruction, and so needs no further configuration info, in most
    cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p><span><strong class="command">Callgrind</strong></span> is a profiler similar in
     concept to Cachegrind, but which also tracks caller-callee
     relationships.  By doing so it is able to show how instruction,
     memory reference and cache miss costs flow between callers and
     callees.  Callgrind collects a large amount of data which is best
     navigated using Josef Weidendorfer's amazing KCachegrind
     visualisation tool (<a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex" target="_top">http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net</a>).
     KCachegrind is a KDE application which presents 
     these profiling results in a
     graphical and easy-to-understand form.</p></li>
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Massif</strong></span> is a heap profiler.
     It measures how much heap memory programs use.  In particular,
     it can give you information about heap blocks, heap 
     administration overheads, and stack sizes.</p>
<p>Heap profiling can help you reduce the amount of
     memory your program uses.  On modern machines with virtual
     memory, this reduces the chances that your program will run out
     of memory, and may make it faster by reducing the amount of
     paging needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong class="command">Helgrind</strong></span> detects synchronisation errors
     in programs that use the POSIX pthreads threading primitives.  It
     detects the following three classes of errors:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Misuses of the POSIX pthreads API.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential deadlocks arising from lock ordering
        problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Data races -- accessing memory without adequate locking.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Problems like these often result in unreproducible,
    timing-dependent crashes, deadlocks and other misbehaviour, and
    can be difficult to find by other means.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<p>A couple of minor tools (<span><strong class="command">Lackey</strong></span> and
<span><strong class="command">Nulgrind</strong></span>) are also supplied.  These aren't
particularly useful -- they exist to illustrate how to create simple
tools and to help the valgrind developers in various ways.  Nulgrind is
the null tool -- it adds no instrumentation.  Lackey is a simple example
tool which counts instructions, memory accesses, and the number of
integer and floating point operations your program does.</p>
<p>Valgrind is closely tied to details of the CPU and operating
system, and to a lesser extent, the compiler and basic C libraries.
Nonetheless, as of version 3.3.0 it supports several platforms:
x86/Linux (mature), amd64/Linux (maturing), ppc32/Linux and
ppc64/Linux (less mature but work well).  There is also experimental
support for ppc32/AIX5 and ppc64/AIX5 (AIX 5.2 and 5.3 only).
Valgrind uses the standard Unix
<code class="computeroutput">./configure</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">make</code>, <code class="computeroutput">make
install</code> mechanism, and we have attempted to ensure that
it works on machines with Linux kernel 2.4.X or 2.6.X and glibc
2.2.X to 2.7.X.</p>
<p>Valgrind is licensed under the <a href="license.gpl.html"> The GNU General Public License</a>,

that you may wish to include in your code (eg.

<p>The Valgrind distribution consists of the Valgrind core, upon
which are built Valgrind tools.  The tools do different kinds of debugging
and profiling.  This manual is structured similarly.</p>
<p>First, we describe the Valgrind core, how to use it, and the flags
it supports.  Then, each tool has its own chapter in this manual.  You
only need to read the documentation for the core and for the tool(s) you
actually use, although you may find it helpful to be at least a little
bit familiar with what all tools do.  If you're new to all this, you probably
want to run the Memcheck tool.  The final chapter explains how to write a
new tool.</p>
<p>Be aware that the core understands some command line flags, and
the tools have their own flags which they know about.  This means
there is no central place describing all the flags that are
accepted -- you have to read the flags documentation both for
<a href="manual-core.html">Valgrind's core</a> and for the tool you want to use.</p>
<p>The manual is quite big and complex.  If you are looking for a
quick getting-started guide, have a look at
<a href="quick-start.html" title="The Valgrind Quick Start Guide">The Valgrind Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>
