<p>The Valgrind tool suite provides a number of debugging and
profiling tools.  The most popular is
Memcheck, a memory checking tool which can detect many common
memory errors such as:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Touching memory you shouldn't (eg. overrunning heap block
    boundaries, or reading/writing freed memory).</p></li>
<li><p>Using values before they have been initialized.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorrect freeing of memory, such as double-freeing heap
    blocks.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leaks.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Memcheck is only one of the tools in the Valgrind suite.
Other tools you may find useful are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Cachegrind: a profiling tool which produces detailed data on
    cache (miss) and branch (misprediction) events.  Statistics are
    gathered for the entire program, for each function, and for each
    line of code, if you need that level of detail.</p></li>
<li><p>Callgrind: a profiling tool that shows cost relationships
    across function calls, optionally with cache simulation similar to
    Cachegrind.  Information gathered by Callgrind can be viewed
    either with an included command line tool, or by using the
    KCachegrind GUI.  KCachegrind is not part of the Valgrind suite 
    -- it is part of the KDE Desktop Environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Massif: a space profiling tool.  It allows you to explore
    in detail which parts of your program allocate memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Helgrind: a debugging tool for threaded programs.  Helgrind
    looks for various kinds of synchronisation errors in code that uses
    the POSIX PThreads API.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, there are a number of "experimental" tools in
    the codebase.  They can be distinguished by the "exp-" prefix on
    their names.  Experimental tools are not subject to the same
    quality control standards that apply to our production-grade tools
    (Memcheck, Cachegrind, Callgrind, Massif and Helgrind).</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The rest of this guide discusses only the Memcheck tool.  For
full documentation on the other tools, and for Memcheck, see the
Valgrind User Manual.</p>
<p>What follows is the minimum information you need to start
detecting memory errors in your program with Memcheck.  Note that this
guide applies to Valgrind version 3.3.0 and later.  Some of the
information is not quite right for earlier versions.</p>

<a name="quick-start.prepare"></a>2. Preparing your program</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Compile your program with <code class="option">-g</code> to include debugging
information so that Memcheck's error messages include exact line
numbers.  Using <code class="computeroutput">-O0</code> is also a good
idea, if you can tolerate the slowdown.  With
<code class="computeroutput">-O1</code> line numbers in error messages can
be inaccurate, although generally speaking Memchecking code compiled at
<code class="computeroutput">-O1</code> works fairly well.  Use of
<code class="computeroutput">-O2</code> and above is not recommended as
Memcheck occasionally reports uninitialised-value errors which don't
really exist.</p>

<a name="quick-start.mcrun"></a>3. Running your program under Memcheck</h2></div></div></div>
<p>If you normally run your program like this:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">    myprog arg1 arg2
</pre>
<p>

Use this command line:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">    valgrind --leak-check=yes myprog arg1 arg2
</pre>
<p>

Memcheck is the default tool.  The <code class="option">--leak-check</code> option
turns on the detailed memory leak detector.</p>
<p>Your program will run much slower (eg. 20 to 30 times) than
normal, and use a lot more memory.  Memcheck will issue messages about
memory errors and leaks that it detects.</p>

<a name="quick-start.interpret"></a>4. Interpreting Memcheck's output</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Here's an example C program with a memory error and a memory leak.

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

  void f(void)
  {
     int* x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
     x[10] = 0;        // problem 1: heap block overrun
  }                    // problem 2: memory leak -- x not freed

  int main(void)
  {
     f();
     return 0;
  }
</pre>
<p>

Most error messages look like the following, which describes problem 1,
the heap block overrun:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
  ==19182== Invalid write of size 4
  ==19182==    at 0x804838F: f (example.c:6)
  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (example.c:11)
  ==19182==  Address 0x1BA45050 is 0 bytes after a block of size 40 alloc'd
  ==19182==    at 0x1B8FF5CD: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:130)
  ==19182==    by 0x8048385: f (example.c:5)
  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (example.c:11)
</pre>
<p>

Things to notice:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>There is a lot of information in each error message; read it
   carefully.</p></li>
<li><p>The 19182 is the process ID;  it's usually unimportant.</p></li>
<li><p>The first line ("Invalid write...") tells you what kind of
   error it is.  Here, the program wrote to some memory it should not
   have due to a heap block overrun.</p></li>
<li><p>Below the first line is a stack trace telling you where the
    problem occurred.  Stack traces can get quite large, and be
    confusing, especially if you are using the C++ STL.  Reading them
    from the bottom up can help.  If the stack trace is not big enough,
    use the <code class="option">--num-callers</code> option to make it
    bigger.</p></li>
<li><p>The code addresses (eg. 0x804838F) are usually unimportant, but
   occasionally crucial for tracking down weirder bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>Some error messages have a second component which describes
    the memory address involved.  This one shows that the written memory
    is just past the end of a block allocated with malloc() on line 5 of
    example.c.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>

It's worth fixing errors in the order they are reported, as later
errors can be caused by earlier errors.  Failing to do this is a
common cause of difficulty with Memcheck.</p>
<p>Memory leak messages look like this:

</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
  ==19182== 40 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 1
  ==19182==    at 0x1B8FF5CD: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:130)
  ==19182==    by 0x8048385: f (a.c:5)
  ==19182==    by 0x80483AB: main (a.c:11)
</pre>
<p>

The stack trace tells you where the leaked memory was allocated.
Memcheck cannot tell you why the memory leaked, unfortunately.  (Ignore
the "vg_replace_malloc.c", that's an implementation detail.)</p>
<p>There are several kinds of leaks; the two most important
categories are:

</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>"definitely lost": your program is leaking memory -- fix
    it!</p></li>
<li><p>"probably lost": your program is leaking memory, unless you're
    doing funny things with pointers (such as moving them to point to
    the middle of a heap block).</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>

If you don't understand an error message, please consult 
<a href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.errormsgs">Explanation of error messages from Memcheck</a> in the <a href="manual.html">Valgrind User Manual</a>
which has examples of all the error messages Memcheck produces.</p>

<div class="sect1" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="quick-start.caveats"></a>5. Caveats</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Memcheck is not perfect;  it occasionally produces false positives,
and there are mechanisms for suppressing these (see 
<a href="manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress">Suppressing errors</a> in the <a href="manual.html">Valgrind User Manual</a>).
However, it is typically right 99% of the time, so you should be wary of
ignoring its error messages.  After all, you wouldn't ignore warning
messages produced by a compiler, right?  The suppression mechanism is
also useful if Memcheck is reporting errors in library code that you
cannot change.  The default suppression set hides a lot of these, but you
may come across more.</p>
<p>Memcheck cannot detect every memory error your program has.
For example, it can't detect out-of-range reads or writes to arrays
that are allocated statically or on the stack.  But it should detect many
errors that could crash your program (eg. cause a segmentation
fault).</p>
<p>Try to make your program so clean that Memcheck reports no
errors.  Once you achieve this state, it is much easier to see when
changes to the program cause Memcheck to report new errors.
Experience from several years of Memcheck use shows that it is
possible to make even huge programs run Memcheck-clean.  For example,
large parts of KDE 3.5.X, and recent versions of OpenOffice.org
(2.3.0) are Memcheck-clean, or very close to it.</p>
