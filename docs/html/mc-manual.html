<p>To use this tool, you may specify <code class="option">--tool=memcheck</code>
on the Valgrind command line.  You don't have to, though, since Memcheck
is the default tool.</p>

<p>Memcheck is Valgrind's heavyweight memory checking tool.  All
reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Memcheck can detect
the following problems:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Use of uninitialised memory</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks</p></li>
<li><p>Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack</p></li>
<li><p>Memory leaks - where pointers to malloc'd blocks are
   lost forever</p></li>
<li><p>Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs
    free/delete/delete []</p></li>
<li><p>Overlapping <code class="computeroutput">src</code> and
    <code class="computeroutput">dst</code> pointers in
    <code class="function">memcpy()</code> and related
    functions</p></li>
</ul></div>

    </span>
</dt>
<dd><p>When enabled, search for memory leaks when the client
      program finishes.  A memory leak means a malloc'd block, which has
      not yet been free'd, but to which no pointer can be found.  Such a
      block can never be free'd by the program, since no pointer to it
      exists.  If set to <code class="varname">summary</code>, it says how many
      leaks occurred.  If set to <code class="varname">full</code> or
      <code class="varname">yes</code>, it gives details of each individual
      leak.</p></dd>
<dt>
<a name="opt.show-reachable"></a><span class="term">
      <code class="option">--show-reachable=&lt;yes|no&gt; [default: no] </code>
    </span>
</dt>
<dd><p>When disabled, the memory leak detector only shows blocks
      for which it cannot find a pointer to at all, or it can only find
      a pointer to the middle of.  These blocks are prime candidates for
      memory leaks.  When enabled, the leak detector also reports on
      blocks which it could find a pointer to.  Your program could, at
      least in principle, have freed such blocks before exit.  Contrast
      this to blocks for which no pointer, or only an interior pointer
      could be found: they are more likely to indicate memory leaks,
      because you do not actually have a pointer to the start of the
      block which you can hand to <code class="function">free</code>, even if you
      wanted to.</p></dd>
<dt>
<a name="opt.leak-resolution"></a><span class="term">
      <code class="option">--leak-resolution=&lt;low|med|high&gt; [default: low] </code>
    </span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>When doing leak checking, determines how willing
      <code class="constant">memcheck</code> is to consider different backtraces to
      be the same.  When set to <code class="varname">low</code>, only the first
      two entries need match.  When <code class="varname">med</code>, four entries
      have to match.  When <code class="varname">high</code>, all entries need to
      match.</p>
<p>For hardcore leak debugging, you probably want to use
      <code class="option">--leak-resolution=high</code> together with
      <code class="option">--num-callers=40</code> or some such large number.  Note
      however that this can give an overwhelming amount of information,
      which is why the defaults are 4 callers and low-resolution
      matching.</p>
<p>Note that the <code class="option">--leak-resolution=</code> setting
      does not affect <code class="constant">memcheck's</code> ability to find
      leaks.  It only changes how the results are presented.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="opt.freelist-vol"></a><span class="term">
      <code class="option">--freelist-vol=&lt;number&gt; [default: 10000000] </code>
    </span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>When the client program releases memory using
      <code class="function">free</code> (in <code class="literal">C</code>) or delete
      (<code class="literal">C++</code>), that memory is not immediately made
      available for re-allocation.  Instead, it is marked inaccessible
      and placed in a queue of freed blocks.  The purpose is to defer as
      long as possible the point at which freed-up memory comes back
      into circulation.  This increases the chance that
      <code class="constant">memcheck</code> will be able to detect invalid
      accesses to blocks for some significant period of time after they
      have been freed.</p>
<p>This flag specifies the maximum total size, in bytes, of the
      blocks in the queue.  The default value is ten million bytes.
      Increasing this increases the total amount of memory used by
      <code class="constant">memcheck</code> but may detect invalid uses of freed
      blocks which would otherwise go undetected.</p>

    </span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>When enabled, assume that reads and writes some small
      distance below the stack pointer are due to bugs in gcc 2.96, and
      does not report them.  The "small distance" is 256 bytes by
      default.  Note that gcc 2.96 is the default compiler on some ancient
      Linux distributions (RedHat 7.X) and so you may need to use this
      flag.  Do not use it if you do not have to, as it can cause real
      errors to be overlooked.  A better alternative is to use a more
      recent gcc/g++ in which this bug is fixed.</p>
<p>You may also need to use this flag when working with
      gcc/g++ 3.X or 4.X on 32-bit PowerPC Linux.  This is because
      gcc/g++ generates code which occasionally accesses below the
      stack pointer, particularly for floating-point to/from integer
      conversions.  This is in violation of the 32-bit PowerPC ELF
      specification, which makes no provision for locations below the
      stack pointer to be accessible.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="opt.partial-loads-ok"></a><span class="term">
      <code class="option">--partial-loads-ok=&lt;yes|no&gt; [default: no] </code>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Controls how <code class="constant">memcheck</code> handles word-sized,
      word-aligned loads from addresses for which some bytes are
      addressable and others are not.  When <code class="varname">yes</code>, such
      loads do not produce an address error.  Instead, loaded bytes
      originating from illegal addresses are marked as uninitialised, and
      those corresponding to legal addresses are handled in the normal
      way.</p>
<p>When <code class="varname">no</code>, loads from partially invalid
      addresses are treated the same as loads from completely invalid
      addresses: an illegal-address error is issued, and the resulting
      bytes are marked as initialised.</p>
<p>Note that code that behaves in this way is in violation of
      the the ISO C/C++ standards, and should be considered broken.  If
      at all possible, such code should be fixed.  This flag should be
      used only as a last resort.</p>

      dangerous uses of undefined value errors.  Set this to
      <code class="varname">no</code> if you don't like seeing undefined value

<a name="mc-manual.errormsgs"></a>4.3. Explanation of error messages from Memcheck</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Despite considerable sophistication under the hood, Memcheck can
only really detect two kinds of errors: use of illegal addresses, and
use of undefined values.  Nevertheless, this is enough to help you
discover all sorts of memory-management problems in your code.  This
section presents a quick summary of what error messages mean.  The
precise behaviour of the error-checking machinery is described in 
<a href="mc-manual.html#mc-manual.machine">Details of Memcheck's checking machinery</a>.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.badrw"></a>4.3.1. Illegal read / Illegal write errors</h3></div></div></div>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
Invalid read of size 4
   at 0x40F6BBCC: (within /usr/lib/libpng.so.2.1.0.9)
   by 0x40F6B804: (within /usr/lib/libpng.so.2.1.0.9)
   by 0x40B07FF4: read_png_image(QImageIO *) (kernel/qpngio.cpp:326)
   by 0x40AC751B: QImageIO::read() (kernel/qimage.cpp:3621)
 Address 0xBFFFF0E0 is not stack'd, malloc'd or free'd
</pre>
<p>This happens when your program reads or writes memory at a place
which Memcheck reckons it shouldn't.  In this example, the program did a
4-byte read at address 0xBFFFF0E0, somewhere within the system-supplied
library libpng.so.2.1.0.9, which was called from somewhere else in the
same library, called from line 326 of <code class="filename">qpngio.cpp</code>,
and so on.</p>
<p>Memcheck tries to establish what the illegal address might relate
to, since that's often useful.  So, if it points into a block of memory
which has already been freed, you'll be informed of this, and also where
the block was free'd at.  Likewise, if it should turn out to be just off
the end of a malloc'd block, a common result of off-by-one-errors in
array subscripting, you'll be informed of this fact, and also where the
block was malloc'd.</p>
<p>In this example, Memcheck can't identify the address.  Actually
the address is on the stack, but, for some reason, this is not a valid
stack address -- it is below the stack pointer and that isn't allowed.
In this particular case it's probably caused by gcc generating invalid
code, a known bug in some ancient versions of gcc.</p>
<p>Note that Memcheck only tells you that your program is about to
access memory at an illegal address.  It can't stop the access from
happening.  So, if your program makes an access which normally would
result in a segmentation fault, you program will still suffer the same
fate -- but you will get a message from Memcheck immediately prior to
this.  In this particular example, reading junk on the stack is
non-fatal, and the program stays alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.uninitvals"></a>4.3.2. Use of uninitialised values</h3></div></div></div>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
   at 0x402DFA94: _IO_vfprintf (_itoa.h:49)
   by 0x402E8476: _IO_printf (printf.c:36)
   by 0x8048472: main (tests/manuel1.c:8)
</pre>
<p>An uninitialised-value use error is reported when your program
uses a value which hasn't been initialised -- in other words, is
undefined.  Here, the undefined value is used somewhere inside the
printf() machinery of the C library.  This error was reported when
running the following small program:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
int main()
{
  int x;
  printf ("x = %d\n", x);
}</pre>
<p>It is important to understand that your program can copy around
junk (uninitialised) data as much as it likes.  Memcheck observes this
and keeps track of the data, but does not complain.  A complaint is
issued only when your program attempts to make use of uninitialised
data.  In this example, x is uninitialised.  Memcheck observes the value
being passed to <code class="literal">_IO_printf</code> and thence to
<code class="literal">_IO_vfprintf</code>, but makes no comment.  However,
<code class="literal">_IO_vfprintf</code> has to examine the value of 
x so it can turn it into the
corresponding ASCII string, and it is at this point that Memcheck
complains.</p>
<p>Sources of uninitialised data tend to be:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Local variables in procedures which have not been initialised,
    as in the example above.</p></li>
<li><p>The contents of malloc'd blocks, before you write something
    there.  In C++, the new operator is a wrapper round malloc, so if
    you create an object with new, its fields will be uninitialised
    until you (or the constructor) fill them in.</p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.badfrees"></a>4.3.3. Illegal frees</h3></div></div></div>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
Invalid free()
   at 0x4004FFDF: free (vg_clientmalloc.c:577)
   by 0x80484C7: main (tests/doublefree.c:10)
 Address 0x3807F7B4 is 0 bytes inside a block of size 177 free'd
   at 0x4004FFDF: free (vg_clientmalloc.c:577)
   by 0x80484C7: main (tests/doublefree.c:10)
</pre>
<p>Memcheck keeps track of the blocks allocated by your program with
malloc/new, so it can know exactly whether or not the argument to
free/delete is legitimate or not.  Here, this test program has freed the
same block twice.  As with the illegal read/write errors, Memcheck
attempts to make sense of the address free'd.  If, as here, the address
is one which has previously been freed, you wil be told that -- making
duplicate frees of the same block easy to spot.</p>

   by 0x4C21788F: OLEFilter::convert(QCString const &amp;) (olefilter.cc:272)
</pre>
<p>In <code class="literal">C++</code> it's important to deallocate memory in a
way compatible with how it was allocated.  The deal is:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>If allocated with
    <code class="function">malloc</code>,
    <code class="function">calloc</code>,
    <code class="function">realloc</code>,
    <code class="function">valloc</code> or
    <code class="function">memalign</code>, you must
    deallocate with <code class="function">free</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If allocated with <code class="function">new[]</code>, you must
    deallocate with <code class="function">delete[]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If allocated with <code class="function">new</code>, you must deallocate
   with <code class="function">delete</code>.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The worst thing is that on Linux apparently it doesn't matter if
you do mix these up, but the same program may then crash on a
different platform, Solaris for example.  So it's best to fix it
properly.  According to the KDE folks "it's amazing how many C++
programmers don't know this".</p>
<p>The reason behind the requirement is as follows.  In some C++
implementations, <code class="function">delete[]</code> must be used for
objects allocated by <code class="function">new[]</code> because the compiler
stores the size of the array and the pointer-to-member to the
destructor of the array's content just before the pointer actually
returned.  This implies a variable-sized overhead in what's returned
by <code class="function">new</code> or <code class="function">new[]</code>.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.badperm"></a>4.3.5. Passing system call parameters with inadequate read/write

<p>Memcheck checks all parameters to system calls:

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>It checks all the direct parameters themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, if a system call needs to read from a buffer provided by

<a name="mc-manual.overlap"></a>4.3.6. Overlapping source and destination blocks</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The following C library functions copy some data from one
memory block to another (or something similar):
<code class="function">memcpy()</code>,
<code class="function">strcpy()</code>,
<code class="function">strncpy()</code>,
<code class="function">strcat()</code>,
<code class="function">strncat()</code>. 
The blocks pointed to by their <code class="computeroutput">src</code> and
<code class="computeroutput">dst</code> pointers aren't allowed to overlap.
Memcheck checks for this.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
==27492== Source and destination overlap in memcpy(0xbffff294, 0xbffff280, 21)
==27492==    at 0x40026CDC: memcpy (mc_replace_strmem.c:71)
==27492==    by 0x804865A: main (overlap.c:40)
</pre>
<p>You don't want the two blocks to overlap because one of them could
get partially overwritten by the copying.</p>
<p>You might think that Memcheck is being overly pedantic reporting
this in the case where <code class="computeroutput">dst</code> is less than
<code class="computeroutput">src</code>.  For example, the obvious way to
implement <code class="function">memcpy()</code> is by copying from the first
byte to the last.  However, the optimisation guides of some
architectures recommend copying from the last byte down to the first.
Also, some implementations of <code class="function">memcpy()</code> zero
<code class="computeroutput">dst</code> before copying, because zeroing the
destination's cache line(s) can improve performance.</p>
<p>In addition, for many of these functions, the POSIX standards
have wording along the lines "If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined."  Hence overlapping copies
violate the standard.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: if you want to write truly portable
code, don't make any assumptions about the language
implementation.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.leaks"></a>4.3.7. Memory leak detection</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Memcheck keeps track of all memory blocks issued in response to
calls to malloc/calloc/realloc/new.  So when the program exits, it knows
which blocks have not been freed.
</p>
<p>If <code class="option">--leak-check</code> is set appropriately, for each
remaining block, Memcheck scans the entire address space of the process,
looking for pointers to the block.  Each block fits into one of the
three following categories.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Still reachable: A pointer to the start of the block is found.
    This usually indicates programming sloppiness.  Since the block is
    still pointed at, the programmer could, at least in principle, free
    it before program exit.  Because these are very common and arguably
    not a problem, Memcheck won't report such blocks unless
    <code class="option">--show-reachable=yes</code> is specified.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly lost, or "dubious": A pointer to the interior of the
    block is found.  The pointer might originally have pointed to the
    start and have been moved along, or it might be entirely unrelated.
    Memcheck deems such a block as "dubious", because it's unclear
    whether or not a pointer to it still exists.</p></li>
<li><p>Definitely lost, or "leaked": The worst outcome is that no
    pointer to the block can be found.  The block is classified as
    "leaked", because the programmer could not possibly have freed it at
    program exit, since no pointer to it exists.  This is likely a
    symptom of having lost the pointer at some earlier point in the
    program.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>For each block mentioned, Memcheck will also tell you where the
block was allocated.  It cannot tell you how or why the pointer to a
leaked block has been lost; you have to work that out for yourself.  In
general, you should attempt to ensure your programs do not have any
leaked or dubious blocks at exit.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
8 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 1 of 14
   at 0x........: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:...)
   by 0x........: mk (leak-tree.c:11)
   by 0x........: main (leak-tree.c:39)

88 (8 direct, 80 indirect) bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost 
                           in loss record 13 of 14
   at 0x........: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:...)
   by 0x........: mk (leak-tree.c:11)
   by 0x........: main (leak-tree.c:25)
</pre>
<p>The first message describes a simple case of a single 8 byte block
that has been definitely lost.  The second case mentions both "direct"
and "indirect" leaks.  The distinction is that a direct leak is a block
which has no pointers to it.  An indirect leak is a block which is only
pointed to by other leaked blocks.  Both kinds of leak are bad.</p>
<p>The precise area of memory in which Memcheck searches for pointers
is: all naturally-aligned machine-word-sized words found in memory
that Memcheck's records indicate is both accessible and initialised.

<a name="mc-manual.machine"></a>4.5. Details of Memcheck's checking machinery</h2></div></div></div>
<p>Read this section if you want to know, in detail, exactly
what and how Memcheck is checking.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.value"></a>4.5.1. Valid-value (V) bits</h3></div></div></div>
<p>It is simplest to think of Memcheck implementing a synthetic CPU
which is identical to a real CPU, except for one crucial detail.  Every
bit (literally) of data processed, stored and handled by the real CPU
has, in the synthetic CPU, an associated "valid-value" bit, which says
whether or not the accompanying bit has a legitimate value.  In the
discussions which follow, this bit is referred to as the V (valid-value)
bit.</p>
<p>Each byte in the system therefore has a 8 V bits which follow it
wherever it goes.  For example, when the CPU loads a word-size item (4
bytes) from memory, it also loads the corresponding 32 V bits from a
bitmap which stores the V bits for the process' entire address space.
If the CPU should later write the whole or some part of that value to
memory at a different address, the relevant V bits will be stored back
in the V-bit bitmap.</p>
<p>In short, each bit in the system has an associated V bit, which
follows it around everywhere, even inside the CPU.  Yes, all the CPU's
registers (integer, floating point, vector and condition registers) have
their own V bit vectors.</p>
<p>Copying values around does not cause Memcheck to check for, or
report on, errors.  However, when a value is used in a way which might
conceivably affect the outcome of your program's computation, the
associated V bits are immediately checked.  If any of these indicate
that the value is undefined, an error is reported.</p>
<p>Here's an (admittedly nonsensical) example:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
int i, j;
int a[10], b[10];
for ( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
  j = a[i];
  b[i] = j;
}</pre>
<p>Memcheck emits no complaints about this, since it merely copies
uninitialised values from <code class="varname">a[]</code> into
<code class="varname">b[]</code>, and doesn't use them in a way which could
affect the behaviour of the program.  However, if
the loop is changed to:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
for ( i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ ) {
  j += a[i];
}
if ( j == 77 ) 
  printf("hello there\n");
</pre>
<p>then Memcheck will complain, at the
<code class="computeroutput">if</code>, that the condition depends on
uninitialised values.  Note that it <span><strong class="command">doesn't</strong></span> complain
at the <code class="varname">j += a[i];</code>, since at that point the
undefinedness is not "observable".  It's only when a decision has to be
made as to whether or not to do the <code class="function">printf</code> -- an
observable action of your program -- that Memcheck complains.</p>
<p>Most low level operations, such as adds, cause Memcheck to use the
V bits for the operands to calculate the V bits for the result.  Even if
the result is partially or wholly undefined, it does not
complain.</p>
<p>Checks on definedness only occur in three places: when a value is
used to generate a memory address, when control flow decision needs to
be made, and when a system call is detected, Memcheck checks definedness
of parameters as required.</p>
<p>If a check should detect undefinedness, an error message is
issued.  The resulting value is subsequently regarded as well-defined.
To do otherwise would give long chains of error messages.  In other
words, once Memcheck reports an undefined value error, it tries to
avoid reporting further errors derived from that same undefined
value.</p>
<p>This sounds overcomplicated.  Why not just check all reads from
memory, and complain if an undefined value is loaded into a CPU
register?  Well, that doesn't work well, because perfectly legitimate C
programs routinely copy uninitialised values around in memory, and we
don't want endless complaints about that.  Here's the canonical example.
Consider a struct like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
struct S { int x; char c; };
struct S s1, s2;
s1.x = 42;
s1.c = 'z';
s2 = s1;
</pre>
<p>The question to ask is: how large is <code class="varname">struct S</code>,
in bytes?  An <code class="varname">int</code> is 4 bytes and a
<code class="varname">char</code> one byte, so perhaps a <code class="varname">struct
S</code> occupies 5 bytes?  Wrong.  All non-toy compilers we know
of will round the size of <code class="varname">struct S</code> up to a whole
number of words, in this case 8 bytes.  Not doing this forces compilers
to generate truly appalling code for accessing arrays of
<code class="varname">struct S</code>'s on some architectures.</p>
<p>So <code class="varname">s1</code> occupies 8 bytes, yet only 5 of them will
be initialised.  For the assignment <code class="varname">s2 = s1</code>, gcc
generates code to copy all 8 bytes wholesale into <code class="varname">s2</code>
without regard for their meaning.  If Memcheck simply checked values as
they came out of memory, it would yelp every time a structure assignment
like this happened.  So the more complicated behaviour described above
is necessary.  This allows <code class="literal">gcc</code> to copy
<code class="varname">s1</code> into <code class="varname">s2</code> any way it likes, and a
warning will only be emitted if the uninitialised values are later
used.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.vaddress"></a>4.5.2. Valid-address (A) bits</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Notice that the previous subsection describes how the validity of
values is established and maintained without having to say whether the
program does or does not have the right to access any particular memory
location.  We now consider the latter question.</p>
<p>As described above, every bit in memory or in the CPU has an
associated valid-value (V) bit.  In addition, all bytes in memory, but
not in the CPU, have an associated valid-address (A) bit.  This
indicates whether or not the program can legitimately read or write that
location.  It does not give any indication of the validity or the data
at that location -- that's the job of the V bits -- only whether or not
the location may be accessed.</p>
<p>Every time your program reads or writes memory, Memcheck checks
the A bits associated with the address.  If any of them indicate an
invalid address, an error is emitted.  Note that the reads and writes
themselves do not change the A bits, only consult them.</p>
<p>So how do the A bits get set/cleared?  Like this:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>When the program starts, all the global data areas are
    marked as accessible.</p></li>
<li><p>When the program does malloc/new, the A bits for exactly the
    area allocated, and not a byte more, are marked as accessible.  Upon
    freeing the area the A bits are changed to indicate
    inaccessibility.</p></li>
<li><p>When the stack pointer register (<code class="literal">SP</code>) moves
    up or down, A bits are set.  The rule is that the area from
    <code class="literal">SP</code> up to the base of the stack is marked as
    accessible, and below <code class="literal">SP</code> is inaccessible.  (If
    that sounds illogical, bear in mind that the stack grows down, not
    up, on almost all Unix systems, including GNU/Linux.)  Tracking
    <code class="literal">SP</code> like this has the useful side-effect that the
    section of stack used by a function for local variables etc is
    automatically marked accessible on function entry and inaccessible
    on exit.</p></li>
<li><p>When doing system calls, A bits are changed appropriately.
    For example, <code class="literal">mmap</code>
    magically makes files appear in the process'
    address space, so the A bits must be updated if <code class="literal">mmap</code>
    succeeds.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, your program can tell Memcheck about such changes
    explicitly, using the client request mechanism described
    above.</p></li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.together"></a>4.5.3. Putting it all together</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Memcheck's checking machinery can be summarised as
follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Each byte in memory has 8 associated V (valid-value) bits,
    saying whether or not the byte has a defined value, and a single A
    (valid-address) bit, saying whether or not the program currently has
    the right to read/write that address.</p></li>
<li><p>When memory is read or written, the relevant A bits are
    consulted.  If they indicate an invalid address, Memcheck emits an
    Invalid read or Invalid write error.</p></li>
<li><p>When memory is read into the CPU's registers, the relevant V
    bits are fetched from memory and stored in the simulated CPU.  They
    are not consulted.</p></li>
<li><p>When a register is written out to memory, the V bits for that
    register are written back to memory too.</p></li>
<li><p>When values in CPU registers are used to generate a memory
    address, or to determine the outcome of a conditional branch, the V
    bits for those values are checked, and an error emitted if any of
    them are undefined.</p></li>
<li><p>When values in CPU registers are used for any other purpose,
    Memcheck computes the V bits for the result, but does not check
    them.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the V bits for a value in the CPU have been checked, they
    are then set to indicate validity.  This avoids long chains of
    errors.</p></li>
<li>
<p>When values are loaded from memory, Memcheck checks the A bits
    for that location and issues an illegal-address warning if needed.
    In that case, the V bits loaded are forced to indicate Valid,
    despite the location being invalid.</p>
<p>This apparently strange choice reduces the amount of confusing
    information presented to the user.  It avoids the unpleasant
    phenomenon in which memory is read from a place which is both
    unaddressable and contains invalid values, and, as a result, you get
    not only an invalid-address (read/write) error, but also a
    potentially large set of uninitialised-value errors, one for every
    time the value is used.</p>
<p>There is a hazy boundary case to do with multi-byte loads from
    addresses which are partially valid and partially invalid.  See
    details of the flag <code class="option">--partial-loads-ok</code> for details.
    </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Memcheck intercepts calls to malloc, calloc, realloc, valloc,
memalign, free, new, new[], delete and delete[].  The behaviour you get
is:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>malloc/new/new[]: the returned memory is marked as addressable
    but not having valid values.  This means you have to write to it
    before you can read it.</p></li>
<li><p>calloc: returned memory is marked both addressable and valid,
    since calloc clears the area to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>realloc: if the new size is larger than the old, the new
    section is addressable but invalid, as with malloc.</p></li>
<li><p>If the new size is smaller, the dropped-off section is marked
    as unaddressable.  You may only pass to realloc a pointer previously
    issued to you by malloc/calloc/realloc.</p></li>
<li><p>free/delete/delete[]: you may only pass to these functions a
    pointer previously issued to you by the corresponding allocation
    function.  Otherwise, Memcheck complains.  If the pointer is indeed
    valid, Memcheck marks the entire area it points at as unaddressable,
    and places the block in the freed-blocks-queue.  The aim is to defer
    as long as possible reallocation of this block.  Until that happens,
    all attempts to access it will elicit an invalid-address error, as
    you would hope.</p></li>

<p>Some programs use custom memory allocators, often for performance
reasons.  Left to itself, Memcheck is unable to "understand" the
behaviour of custom allocation schemes and so may miss errors and
leaks in your program.  What this section describes is a way to give
Memcheck enough of a description of your custom allocator that it can
make at least some sense of what is happening.</p>
<p>There are many different sorts of custom allocator, so Memcheck
attempts to reason about them using a loose, abstract model.  We
use the following terminology when describing custom allocation
systems:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Custom allocation involves a set of independent "memory pools".
    </p></li>
<li><p>Memcheck's notion of a a memory pool consists of a single "anchor
    address" and a set of non-overlapping "chunks" associated with the
    anchor address.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically a pool's anchor address is the address of a 
    book-keeping "header" structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically the pool's chunks are drawn from a contiguous
    "superblock" acquired through the system malloc() or mmap().</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Keep in mind that the last two points above say "typically": the
Valgrind mempool client request API is intentionally vague about the
exact structure of a mempool. There is no specific mention made of
headers or superblocks. Nevertheless, the following picture may help
elucidate the intention of the terms in the API:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
   "pool"
   (anchor address)
   |
   v
   +--------+---+
   | header | o |
   +--------+-|-+
              |
              v                  superblock
              +------+---+--------------+---+------------------+
              |      |rzB|  allocation  |rzB|                  |
              +------+---+--------------+---+------------------+
                         ^              ^
                         |              |
                       "addr"     "addr"+"size"
</pre>
<p>
Note that the header and the superblock may be contiguous or
discontiguous, and there may be multiple superblocks associated with a
single header; such variations are opaque to Memcheck. The API
only requires that your allocation scheme can present sensible values
of "pool", "addr" and "size".</p>
<p>
Typically, before making client requests related to mempools, a client
program will have allocated such a header and superblock for their
mempool, and marked the superblock NOACCESS using the
<code class="varname">VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_NOACCESS</code> client request.</p>
<p>
When dealing with mempools, the goal is to maintain a particular
invariant condition: that Memcheck believes the unallocated portions
of the pool's superblock (including redzones) are NOACCESS. To
maintain this invariant, the client program must ensure that the
superblock starts out in that state; Memcheck cannot make it so, since
Memcheck never explicitly learns about the superblock of a pool, only
the allocated chunks within the pool.</p>
<p>
Once the header and superblock for a pool are established and properly
marked, there are a number of client requests programs can use to
inform Memcheck about changes to the state of a mempool:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>
    <code class="varname">VALGRIND_CREATE_MEMPOOL(pool, rzB, is_zeroed)</code>:
    This request registers the address "pool" as the anchor address 
    for a memory pool. It also provides a size "rzB", specifying how 
    large the redzones placed around chunks allocated from the pool 
    should be. Finally, it provides an "is_zeroed" flag that specifies 
    whether the pool's chunks are zeroed (more precisely: defined) 
    when allocated.
    </p>
<p>
    Upon completion of this request, no chunks are associated with the
    pool.  The request simply tells Memcheck that the pool exists, so that
    subsequent calls can refer to it as a pool.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_DESTROY_MEMPOOL(pool)</code>:
    This request tells Memcheck that a pool is being torn down. Memcheck
    then removes all records of chunks associated with the pool, as well
    as its record of the pool's existence. While destroying its records of
    a mempool, Memcheck resets the redzones of any live chunks in the pool
    to NOACCESS.
    </p></li>
<li><p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_ALLOC(pool, addr, size)</code>:
    This request informs Memcheck that a "size"-byte chunk has been
    allocated at "addr", and associates the chunk with the specified
    "pool". If the pool was created with nonzero "rzB" redzones, Memcheck
    will mark the "rzB" bytes before and after the chunk as NOACCESS. If
    the pool was created with the "is_zeroed" flag set, Memcheck will mark
    the chunk as DEFINED, otherwise Memcheck will mark the chunk as
    UNDEFINED.
    </p></li>
<li><p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_FREE(pool, addr)</code>:
    This request informs Memcheck that the chunk at "addr" should no
    longer be considered allocated. Memcheck will mark the chunk
    associated with "addr" as NOACCESS, and delete its record of the
    chunk's existence.
    </p></li>
<li>
<p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_TRIM(pool, addr, size)</code>:
    This request "trims" the chunks associated with "pool". The request
    only operates on chunks associated with "pool". Trimming is formally
    defined as:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle">
<li><p> All chunks entirely inside the range [addr,addr+size) are
        preserved.</p></li>
<li><p>All chunks entirely outside the range [addr,addr+size) are
        discarded, as though <code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_FREE</code>
        was called on them. </p></li>
<li><p>All other chunks must intersect with the range 
        [addr,addr+size); areas outside the intersection are marked as 
        NOACCESS, as though they had been independently freed with 
        <code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_FREE</code>.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>This is a somewhat rare request, but can be useful in 
    implementing the type of mass-free operations common in custom 
    LIFO allocators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_MOVE_MEMPOOL(poolA, poolB)</code>:
    This request informs Memcheck that the pool previously anchored at
    address "poolA" has moved to anchor address "poolB". This is a rare
    request, typically only needed if you realloc() the header of 
    a mempool.</p>
<p>No memory-status bits are altered by this request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
    <code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_CHANGE(pool, addrA, addrB, size)</code>:
    This request informs Memcheck that the chunk previously allocated at
    address "addrA" within "pool" has been moved and/or resized, and should
    be changed to cover the region [addrB,addrB+size). This is a rare
    request, typically only needed if you realloc() a superblock or wish
    to extend a chunk without changing its memory-status bits.
    </p>
<p>No memory-status bits are altered by this request.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p><code class="varname">VALGRIND_MEMPOOL_EXISTS(pool)</code>:
    This request informs the caller whether or not Memcheck is currently 
    tracking a mempool at anchor address "pool". It evaluates to 1 when 
    there is a mempool associated with that address, 0 otherwise. This is a 
    rare request, only useful in circumstances when client code might have 
    lost track of the set of active mempools.

<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap"></a>4.8. Debugging MPI Parallel Programs with Valgrind</h2></div></div></div>
<p> Valgrind supports debugging of distributed-memory applications
which use the MPI message passing standard.  This support consists of a
library of wrapper functions for the
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_*</code> interface.  When incorporated
into the application's address space, either by direct linking or by
<code class="computeroutput">LD_PRELOAD</code>, the wrappers intercept
calls to <code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Send</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Recv</code>, etc.  They then
use client requests to inform Valgrind of memory state changes caused
by the function being wrapped.  This reduces the number of false
positives that Memcheck otherwise typically reports for MPI
applications.</p>
<p>The wrappers also take the opportunity to carefully check
size and definedness of buffers passed as arguments to MPI functions, hence
detecting errors such as passing undefined data to
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Send</code>, or receiving data into a
buffer which is too small.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the rest of Valgrind, the wrapper library is subject to a
BSD-style license, so you can link it into any code base you like.
See the top of <code class="computeroutput">auxprogs/libmpiwrap.c</code>
for license details.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.build"></a>4.8.1. Building and installing the wrappers</h3></div></div></div>
<p> The wrapper library will be built automatically if possible.
Valgrind's configure script will look for a suitable
<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> to build it with.  This must be
the same <code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> you use to build the
MPI application you want to debug.  By default, Valgrind tries
<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code>, but you can specify a
different one by using the configure-time flag
<code class="computeroutput">--with-mpicc=</code>.  Currently the
wrappers are only buildable with
<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code>s which are based on GNU
<code class="computeroutput">gcc</code> or Intel's
<code class="computeroutput">icc</code>.</p>
<p>Check that the configure script prints a line like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
checking for usable MPI2-compliant mpicc and mpi.h... yes, mpicc
</pre>
<p>If it says <code class="computeroutput">... no</code>, your
<code class="computeroutput">mpicc</code> has failed to compile and link
a test MPI2 program.</p>
<p>If the configure test succeeds, continue in the usual way with
<code class="computeroutput">make</code> and <code class="computeroutput">make
install</code>.  The final install tree should then contain
<code class="computeroutput">libmpiwrap.so</code>.
</p>
<p>Compile up a test MPI program (eg, MPI hello-world) and try
this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
LD_PRELOAD=$prefix/lib/valgrind/&lt;platform&gt;/libmpiwrap.so   \
           mpirun [args] $prefix/bin/valgrind ./hello
</pre>
<p>You should see something similar to the following</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
valgrind MPI wrappers 31901: Active for pid 31901
valgrind MPI wrappers 31901: Try MPIWRAP_DEBUG=help for possible options
</pre>
<p>repeated for every process in the group.  If you do not see
these, there is an build/installation problem of some kind.</p>
<p> The MPI functions to be wrapped are assumed to be in an ELF
shared object with soname matching
<code class="computeroutput">libmpi.so*</code>.  This is known to be
correct at least for Open MPI and Quadrics MPI, and can easily be
changed if required.</p>

<p>Compile your MPI application as usual, taking care to link it

Valgrind build was configured with.</p>
<p>
Use the following basic scheme to run your application on Valgrind with
the wrappers engaged:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">

   [application] [app-args]
</pre>
<p>As an alternative to
<code class="computeroutput">LD_PRELOAD</code>ing
<code class="computeroutput">libmpiwrap.so</code>, you can simply link it
to your application if desired.  This should not disturb native
behaviour of your application in any way.</p>

<p>All MPI2 functions except
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wtick</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wtime</code> and
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Pcontrol</code> have wrappers.  The
first two are not wrapped because they return a 
<code class="computeroutput">double</code>, and Valgrind's
function-wrap mechanism cannot handle that (it could easily enough be
extended to).  <code class="computeroutput">MPI_Pcontrol</code> cannot be
wrapped as it has variable arity: 
<code class="computeroutput">int MPI_Pcontrol(const int level, ...)</code></p>
<p>Most functions are wrapped with a default wrapper which does
nothing except complain or abort if it is called, depending on
settings in <code class="computeroutput">MPIWRAP_DEBUG</code> listed
above.  The following functions have "real", do-something-useful
wrappers:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
PMPI_Send PMPI_Bsend PMPI_Ssend PMPI_Rsend

PMPI_Recv PMPI_Get_count

PMPI_Isend PMPI_Ibsend PMPI_Issend PMPI_Irsend

PMPI_Irecv
PMPI_Wait PMPI_Waitall
PMPI_Test PMPI_Testall

PMPI_Iprobe PMPI_Probe

PMPI_Cancel

PMPI_Sendrecv

PMPI_Type_commit PMPI_Type_free

PMPI_Pack PMPI_Unpack

PMPI_Bcast PMPI_Gather PMPI_Scatter PMPI_Alltoall
PMPI_Reduce PMPI_Allreduce PMPI_Op_create

PMPI_Comm_create PMPI_Comm_dup PMPI_Comm_free PMPI_Comm_rank PMPI_Comm_size

PMPI_Error_string
PMPI_Init PMPI_Initialized PMPI_Finalize
</pre>
<p> A few functions such as
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Address</code> are listed as
<code class="computeroutput">HAS_NO_WRAPPER</code>.  They have no wrapper
at all as there is nothing worth checking, and giving a no-op wrapper
would reduce performance for no reason.</p>
<p> Note that the wrapper library itself can itself generate large
numbers of calls to the MPI implementation, especially when walking
complex types.  The most common functions called are
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Extent</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Type_get_envelope</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Type_get_contents</code>, and
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Type_free</code>.  </p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.limitations.types"></a>4.8.4.2. Types</h4></div></div></div>
<p> MPI-1.1 structured types are supported, and walked exactly.
The currently supported combiners are
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_NAMED</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_CONTIGUOUS</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_VECTOR</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_HVECTOR</code>
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_INDEXED</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_HINDEXED</code> and
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_COMBINER_STRUCT</code>.  This should
cover all MPI-1.1 types.  The mechanism (function
<code class="computeroutput">walk_type</code>) should extend easily to
cover MPI2 combiners.</p>
<p>MPI defines some named structured types
(<code class="computeroutput">MPI_FLOAT_INT</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_DOUBLE_INT</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_LONG_INT</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_2INT</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_SHORT_INT</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_LONG_DOUBLE_INT</code>) which are pairs
of some basic type and a C <code class="computeroutput">int</code>.
Unfortunately the MPI specification makes it impossible to look inside
these types and see where the fields are.  Therefore these wrappers
assume the types are laid out as <code class="computeroutput">struct { float val;
int loc; }</code> (for
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_FLOAT_INT</code>), etc, and act
accordingly.  This appears to be correct at least for Open MPI 1.0.2
and for Quadrics MPI.</p>
<p>If <code class="computeroutput">strict</code> is an option specified 
in <code class="computeroutput">MPIWRAP_DEBUG</code>, the application
will abort if an unhandled type is encountered.  Otherwise, the 
application will print a warning message and continue.</p>
<p>Some effort is made to mark/check memory ranges corresponding to
arrays of values in a single pass.  This is important for performance
since asking Valgrind to mark/check any range, no matter how small,
carries quite a large constant cost.  This optimisation is applied to
arrays of primitive types (<code class="computeroutput">double</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">float</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">int</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">long</code>, <code class="computeroutput">long
long</code>, <code class="computeroutput">short</code>,
<code class="computeroutput">char</code>, and <code class="computeroutput">long
double</code> on platforms where <code class="computeroutput">sizeof(long
double) == 8</code>).  For arrays of all other types, the
wrappers handle each element individually and so there can be a very
large performance cost.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.writingwrappers"></a>4.8.5. Writing new wrappers</h3></div></div></div>
<p>
For the most part the wrappers are straightforward.  The only
significant complexity arises with nonblocking receives.</p>
<p>The issue is that <code class="computeroutput">MPI_Irecv</code>
states the recv buffer and returns immediately, giving a handle
(<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Request</code>) for the transaction.
Later the user will have to poll for completion with
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wait</code> etc, and when the
transaction completes successfully, the wrappers have to paint the
recv buffer.  But the recv buffer details are not presented to
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Wait</code> -- only the handle is.  The
library therefore maintains a shadow table which associates
uncompleted <code class="computeroutput">MPI_Request</code>s with the
corresponding buffer address/count/type.  When an operation completes,
the table is searched for the associated address/count/type info, and
memory is marked accordingly.</p>
<p>Access to the table is guarded by a (POSIX pthreads) lock, so as
to make the library thread-safe.</p>
<p>The table is allocated with
<code class="computeroutput">malloc</code> and never
<code class="computeroutput">free</code>d, so it will show up in leak
checks.</p>
<p>Writing new wrappers should be fairly easy.  The source file is
<code class="computeroutput">auxprogs/libmpiwrap.c</code>.  If possible,
find an existing wrapper for a function of similar behaviour to the
one you want to wrap, and use it as a starting point.  The wrappers
are organised in sections in the same order as the MPI 1.1 spec, to
aid navigation.  When adding a wrapper, remember to comment out the
definition of the default wrapper in the long list of defaults at the
bottom of the file (do not remove it, just comment it out).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="mc-manual.mpiwrap.whattoexpect"></a>4.8.6. What to expect when using the wrappers</h3></div></div></div>
<p>The wrappers should reduce Memcheck's false-error rate on MPI
applications.  Because the wrapping is done at the MPI interface,
there will still potentially be a large number of errors reported in
the MPI implementation below the interface.  The best you can do is
try to suppress them.</p>
<p>You may also find that the input-side (buffer
length/definedness) checks find errors in your MPI use, for example
passing too short a buffer to
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_Recv</code>.</p>
<p>Functions which are not wrapped may increase the false
error rate.  A possible approach is to run with
<code class="computeroutput">MPI_DEBUG</code> containing
<code class="computeroutput">warn</code>.  This will show you functions
which lack proper wrappers but which are nevertheless used.  You can
then write wrappers for them.
</p>
<p>A known source of potential false errors are the
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Reduce</code> family of functions, when
using a custom (user-defined) reduction function.  In a reduction
operation, each node notionally sends data to a "central point" which
uses the specified reduction function to merge the data items into a
single item.  Hence, in general, data is passed between nodes and fed
to the reduction function, but the wrapper library cannot mark the
transferred data as initialised before it is handed to the reduction
function, because all that happens "inside" the
<code class="computeroutput">PMPI_Reduce</code> call.  As a result you
may see false positives reported in your reduction function.</p>
