<p>From Nordic mythology.  Originally (before release) the project
  was named Heimdall, after the watchman of the Nordic gods.  He could
  "see a hundred miles by day or night, hear the grass growing, see the
  wool growing on a sheep's back" (etc).  This would have been a great
  name, but it was already taken by a security package "Heimdal".</p>
<p>Keeping with the Nordic theme, Valgrind was chosen.  Valgrind is
  the name of the main entrance to Valhalla (the Hall of the Chosen
  Slain in Asgard).  Over this entrance there resides a wolf and over it
  there is the head of a boar and on it perches a huge eagle, whose eyes
  can see to the far regions of the nine worlds.  Only those judged
  worthy by the guardians are allowed to pass through Valgrind.  All
  others are refused entrance.</p>
<p>It's not short for "value grinder", although that's not a bad
  guess.</p>

<p>When the program exits, Valgrind runs the procedure

    memory debuggers, so they can ask glibc to free up any memory it has
    used.  Doing that is needed to ensure that Valgrind doesn't
    incorrectly report space leaks in glibc.</p>
<p>Problem is that running <code class="literal">__libc_freeres()</code> in
    older glibc versions causes this crash.</p>
<p>Workaround for 1.1.X and later versions of Valgrind: use the
    <code class="option">--run-libc-freeres=no</code> flag.  You may then get space
    leak reports for glibc allocations (please don't report these to
    the glibc people, since they are not real leaks), but at least the

    report.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that your program has a bug and

<p>Valgrind can handle dynamically generated code, so long as
    none of the generated code is later overwritten by other generated
    code.  If this happens, though, things will go wrong as Valgrind
    will continue running its translations of the old code (this is true
    on x86 and amd64, on PowerPC there are explicit cache flush
    instructions which Valgrind detects and honours).
    You should try running with
    <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code> in this case.  Valgrind will run
    much more slowly, but should detect the use of the out-of-date
    code.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have the source code to the JIT compiler
    you can insert calls to the
    <code class="computeroutput">VALGRIND_DISCARD_TRANSLATIONS</code>
    client request to mark out-of-date code, saving you from using
    <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from this, in theory Valgrind can run any Java program
    just fine, even those that use JNI and are partially implemented in
    other languages like C and C++.  In practice, Java implementations
    tend to do nasty things that most programs do not, and Valgrind
    sometimes falls over these corner cases.</p>
<p>If your Java programs do not run under Valgrind, even with
    <code class="option">--smc-check=all</code>, please file a bug report and
    hopefully we'll be able to fix the problem.</p>

<p>First of all: relax, it's probably not a bug, but a feature.
    Many implementations of the C++ standard libraries use their own
    memory pool allocators.  Memory for quite a number of destructed
    objects is not immediately freed and given back to the OS, but kept
    in the pool(s) for later re-use.  The fact that the pools are not
    freed at the exit() of the program cause Valgrind to report this
    memory as still reachable.  The behaviour not to free pools at the
    exit() could be called a bug of the library though.</p>
<p>Using gcc, you can force the STL to use malloc and to free
    memory as soon as possible by globally disabling memory caching.
    Beware!  Doing so will probably slow down your program, sometimes
    drastically.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>With gcc 2.91, 2.95, 3.0 and 3.1, compile all source using
        the STL with <code class="literal">-D__USE_MALLOC</code>. Beware!  This was
        removed from gcc starting with version 3.3.</p></li>
<li><p>With gcc 3.2.2 and later, you should export the
        environment variable <code class="literal">GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW</code> before
        running your program.</p></li>
<li><p>With gcc 3.4 and later, that variable has changed name to
        <code class="literal">GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW</code>.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>There are other ways to disable memory pooling: using the
    <code class="literal">malloc_alloc</code> template with your objects (not
    portable, but should work for gcc) or even writing your own memory
    allocators. But all this goes beyond the scope of this FAQ.  Start
    by reading 
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq/index.html#4_4_leak" target="_top">
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq/index.html#4_4_leak</a> if
    you absolutely want to do that. But beware: 
    allocators belong to the more messy parts of the STL and
    people went to great lengths to make the STL portable across
    platforms. Chances are good that your solution will work on your
    platform, but not on others.</p>

<p>If they're not long enough, use <code class="option">--num-callers</code>

<p>If they're not detailed enough, make sure you are compiling
    with <code class="option">-g</code> to add debug information.  And don't strip
    symbol tables (programs should be unstripped unless you run 'strip'
    on them; some libraries ship stripped).</p>
<p>Also, for leak reports involving shared objects, if the shared
    object is unloaded before the program terminates, Valgrind will
    discard the debug information and the error message will be full of
    <code class="literal">???</code> entries.  The workaround here is to avoid
    calling dlclose() on these shared objects.</p>

    know of are printing 'bcmp' instead of 'memcmp', 'index' instead of
    'strchr', and 'rindex' instead of 'strrchr'.</p></td>

<p>When a program runs under Valgrind, its environment is slightly
    different to when it runs natively.  For example, the memory layout is
    different, and the way that threads are scheduled is different.</p>
<p>Most of the time this doesn't make any difference, but it can,
    particularly if your program is buggy.  For example, if your program
    crashes because it erroneously accesses memory that is unaddressable,
    it's possible that this memory will not be unaddressable when run under
    Valgrind.  Alternatively, if your program has data races, these may not
    manifest under Valgrind.</p>
<p>There isn't anything you can do to change this, it's just the
    nature of the way Valgrind works that it cannot exactly replicate a
    native execution environment.  In the case where your program crashes
    due to a memory error when run natively but not when run under Valgrind,
    in most cases Memcheck should identify the bad memory operation.</p>

<p>There are two possible causes of this.</p>
<p>First, by default, Valgrind only traces the top-level process.
    So if your program spawns children, they won't be traced by Valgrind
    by default.  Also, if your program is started by a shell script,
    Perl script, or something similar, Valgrind will trace the shell, or
    the Perl interpreter, or equivalent.</p>
<p>To trace child processes, use the
    <code class="option">--trace-children=yes</code> option.</p>
<p>If you are tracing large trees of processes, it can be less
    disruptive to have the output sent over the network.  Give Valgrind
    the flag <code class="option">--log-socket=127.0.0.1:12345</code> (if you want
    logging output sent to port <code class="literal">12345</code> on
    <code class="literal">localhost</code>).  You can use the valgrind-listener
    program to listen on that port:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
valgrind-listener 12345
</pre>
<p>Obviously you have to start the listener process first.  See
    the manual for more details.</p>
<p>Second, if your program is statically linked, most Valgrind
    tools won't work as well, because they won't be able to replace
    certain functions, such as malloc(), with their own versions.  A key
    indicator of this is if Memcheck says:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
</pre>
<p>
    when you know your program calls malloc().  The workaround is to
    avoid statically linking your program.</p>

<p>Yes!  Use the <code class="option">--gen-suppressions=yes</code> feature

<p>We'd love to improve these errors, but we don't know how to do it
    without huge performance penalties.</p>
<p>You can use the client request
    <code class="computeroutput">VALGRIND_CHECK_VALUE_IS_DEFINED</code> to help
    track these errors down -- work backwards from the point where the
    uninitialised error occurs, checking suspect values until you find the
    cause.  This requires editing, compiling and re-running your program
    multiple times, which is a pain, but still easier than debugging the
    problem without Memcheck's help.</p>
<p>As for eager reporting of copies of uninitialised memory values,
    this has been suggested multiple times.  Unfortunately, almost all
    programs legitimately copy uninitialised memory values around (because
    compilers pad structs to preserve alignment) and eager checking leads to
    hundreds of false positives.  Therefore Memcheck does not support eager
    checking at this time.</p>
